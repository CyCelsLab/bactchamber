# bactchamber
Agarose pad chamber for live cell imaging made using a 3D printed structure for stability over long term imaging.
This work is associated with a manuscript in review and should be cited if you use the design:

BioRXiV

The stl files were used on a Ultimaker2+ 3D printer with ) with a 4 mm poly lactic acid (PLA) filament with printer settings of infill 60%, adhesion ON, layer height = 0.2mm while the other parameters were set to instrument defaults.
Files:
1. Agarose-clip-holder-setup.stl contains the holder that fits on the microscopy stage and the mold used to make the agarose pad that fits within the holder. 
2. clip_clip.stl contains the clips that slide over the holder and keep the holder-mold setup together.
